I'm Irina, a Frontend Developer with a passion for creating stunning, user-friendly websites. I completed Yandex.Praktikum two years ago and had the privilege of contributing to the development of the website for the renowned Lubimovka drama festival (https://lubimovka.art) during my studies.

My skill set includes TypeScript, JavaScript, RxJS, HTML5, CSS (SCSS, Saas), Angular, React, Next.js, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am well-versed in SOLID principles, design patterns, and data structures, ensuring that my code is robust, efficient, and easily maintainable.

If you're looking to build a modern website, develop an interactive web application, or enhance the functionality of an existing platform, I can help bring your vision to life. I am passionate about innovation and committed to delivering high-quality results, making me the perfect choice for your next project.
